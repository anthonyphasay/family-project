    <h1>The Family: A Proclamation to the World</h1>

    <p id="par">In 1995, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints introduced "The Family: A Proclamation to the World", which was
        a document declaring the principles and doctrines on the family unit. These includes an establishment of
        "marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator's 
        plan for the eternal destiny of His children" (The Family, para. 1).
    </p>
    <p>American family life can be defined according to Steven Mintz 
        and Susan Kellogg in their book Domestic Revolutions: A social History of American Family Life 
        as “a married couple and their minor children living 
        together in a common residence” (Mintz et al., 1989).
    </p>
    <p>
        However, family life is different around the world and have different
         definitions. Chinese and Korean family values include “expression of 
         responsibility, respect, sacrifice, and family harmony that regulates
          children’s attitudes and behavior towards family-based support” (Sung, 2000).
    </p>
    <p>In some cultures, as soon as the children turn 18, they would move out of their parents’ house,
       but in others, they stay even after till they are married. The Phillipine's country consitution
       refers to the family as the "foundation of the nation"(Eyre, 2020). Many differences in family
       units arise.

        I have wondered how the proclamation has been interpreted for those from a different cultural background than American. Do they have similar times of prayer, or family home evening activities? 
        
        I asked 3 different people from different ethnic backgrounds on their experiences with their family.
        This was to see how different families from different ethnic background view and apply
        the following section of <i>The Family: A Proclamation to the World</i>:
        </p>
        <p>"The family is ordained of God. Marriage between man and woman is essential to His eternal plan. 
            Children are entitled to birth within the bonds of matrimony, and to be reared by a father and a 
            mother who honor marital vows with complete fidelity. Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved 
            when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. Successful marriages and families are established and 
            maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome 
            recreational activities. By divine design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and 
            are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families. Mothers are primarily responsible 
            for the nurture of their children. In these sacred responsibilities, fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another
             as equal partners. Disability, death, or other circumstances may necessitate individual adaptation. Extended families should 
             lend support when needed."</p>

    <div class="question">Does your family do ‘family home evenings?’ If so, what is a typical ‘family home evening’ like?
    </div>
    <div>When I was still at home with my parents and siblings, yes. It started with singing the hymns and a family prayer, and then it could either be watching a specific conference message, playing Boggle, or sharing our talents (playing the piano/guitar, singing, etc).

        If with my husband, no.
        </div>
    <div class="question">Does your family pray together? When?</div>
        <div>With parents, yes. Usually dinner and before going to bed because those are the times when everyone’s home.
            With my husband, yes. Before going to bed usually.
        </div>
    <div class="question">How does your family respect each other?</div>
        <div>I guess with the people I hung out with, my parents were not as controlling as other parents.

            My husband is very respectful of my space and the problems I deal with, especially in regard to mental health.
            </div>
    <div class="question">What are wholesome recreational activities that your family does together?</div>
       <div> Watching movies, playing games, and making food.</div>
    <div class="question">How does your culture affect family time? In what ways?</div>
        <div>My family will always do meals together (not lunch though because we’re usually at school or my parents are at work). That’s how it was when we were all still together. Me, my siblings, and my parents all live separately now (due to school or work), so there’s not a lot of opportunities for us to get together. I know my siblings try to keep up with them through video calls and messages,
             but due to past family cultural differences, I don’t do those as much.

    </div>

        the most part we respect each other.
        </div>

    <p class="last">What I’ve learned through these interviews was that certain 
        family values exists from different parts of the world (even in a 
        religious context). Some of these includes recreational activities 
        that let’s others work together whether that is in board games or 
        cooking, they help the units to work on a common goal. From an LDS 
        perspective, these individuals would have family prayers together however, 
        Dasom and Esther’s family pray at night while Ethan’s family prays in the morning. 
        Time differences in prayers can say a lot of things such as how busy each family might be. 
        The most important part though is that everyone that was interviewed shared their experiences
         and how in line they were with the proclamation. Through prayers, respect, and recreational activities, 
         these are a few of other counsels that the presidency of the church as proclaimed to helping build successful
          marriages and families. This will be something that I will take into consideration when I am
        preparing for my own family, that we can use the proclamation to build a successful marriage and family.</p>
